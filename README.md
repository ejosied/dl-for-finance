Deep Learning for Finance:
An exploration of deep learning techniques to make predictions on time series stock data

This is a custom project exploring applications of deep learning in finance for Applied Deep Learning at Columbia University. Though finance data like stock trends are often best suited for supervised learning models, deep learning approaches can combine financial time series data with relevant text from the news. I plan to use Yahoo finance data and a collection of reputable news sources; the extent of the latter depends on which version of the project I complete. The potential versions of this project are as follows:

	1) *Minimal goal*: Explore DNNs, RNNs, and LSTM approaches to predict decisions for one stock, perhaps S&P 500.
	2) *Expected goal*: Extend the minimal goal to include text input from news sources, and develop a model to predict decisions for multiple stocks. Potential news sources are the Financial Times and the Harvard Business Review. I hope to use an existing text vectorizer trained specifically on a finance-focused corpus.
  3) *Stretch goal*: Implement scraping to obtain more diverse and more current text sources for stronger sentiment analysis.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92758942/200120607-4210239b-04ab-4c1e-a507-a4205b302d31.png)
